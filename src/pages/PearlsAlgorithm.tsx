    title="Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design"
    body={`In Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design Richard Bird takes a radically new approach to algorithm design, namely design by calculation. The body of the text is divided into 30 short chapters, called pearls, each of which deals with a particular programming problem. These problems, some of which are completely new, are drawn from sources as diverse as games and puzzles, intriguing combinatorial tasks and more familiar algorithms in areas such as data compression and string matching`}
